Web Development Exercise: CSS Grid Layout Practice

Objective:
Use CSS Grid to replicate a YouTube video screenshot layout. Provided images will serve as elements within the page. Your challenge is to accurately assemble these elements and style additional components using HTML and CSS to match the example screenshot.
Resources Provided:
1.	Icon Image (for channel logo)
2.	Video Thumbnail Image
3.	Three-dots Menu Image
4.	Verification Tick Icon
   
Instructions:
1.	Initialize an HTML file and establish a link to an external CSS stylesheet.
2.	In the HTML, define a div element that will act as a CSS Grid container for the screenshot's components.
3.	Insert the provided images into the grid container at their respective positions.
4.	Recreate the text elements, including:
•	Video title: "Flexbox or grid - How to decide?"
•	Channel name: "Kevin Powell"
•	View count and upload time: "664K views • 2 years ago"
5.	Use CSS to style all elements, striving to match the layout, typography, colors, and spacing seen in the provided screenshot example.
6.	Implement grid-template-areas or grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows within your CSS to structure the grid.
7.	Design the layout to be responsive, ensuring it adapts to different browser window sizes while maintaining the integrity of the design.
   
Deliverables:
•	HTML file with the structure of the page.
•	CSS file with the styles and grid layout.
•	(Optional) Screenshots of the layout at various screen widths to showcase responsive design.

Evaluation Criteria:
•	Fidelity to the original screenshot in terms of layout and style.
•	Effective and semantic use of CSS Grid.
•	Responsive design implementation.
•	Code quality, including readability and organization.

Notes:
•	Consider using modern CSS features such as variables and flexbox for ancillary styling.
•	Pay attention to the interactive states (like hover effects) that might be present in the original design.
•	Validate your HTML and CSS to ensure compatibility and adherence to web standards.

Purpose: This exercise is crafted to enhance your skills in CSS Grid layout, precision in UI replication, and responsive design principles. It is an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical scenario, simulating real-world web development tasks.
